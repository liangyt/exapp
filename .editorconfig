#indent_style: set to tab or space to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.
#indent_size: a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). When set to tab, the value of tab_width (if specified) will be used.
#tab_width: a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and doesn't usually need to be specified.
#end_of_line: set to lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented.
#charset: set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set. Use of utf-8-bom is discouraged.
#trim_trailing_whitespace: set to true to remove any whitespace characters preceding newline characters and false to ensure it doesn't.
#insert_final_newline: set to true ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn't.
#root: special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections. Set to true to stop .editorconfig files search on current file.
